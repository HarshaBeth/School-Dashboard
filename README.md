# School Dashboard System
This project was made for my final project in "Introduction to Programming" module.

<p align="justify">
I created a system where teachers can enter grades for students in their subjects. Similarly, students can check their grades for each subject using teir module ID and student ID.
In the event that the grades aren't entered or the given student/module ID does not exist, an error message will be displayed.</p>
